\chapter{Questions}

From the very childhood we all ask questions. We are curious and we search for answers. Here are some questions that fascinate me.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Where do we come from?
    \item Is it possible to comb a hairy ball?
    \item Can we deduce every true statement?
    \item Can we travel to the future?
    \item Can we build a universal computing machine?
    \item Can we send messages in obscure form?
    \item Why do people do mathematics?
    \item Can we build humane machines?
    \item Can we order the points of a line?
    \item Can we always choose?
    \item What separates future from the past?
    \item Is there present outside here?
    \item Are patents good?
    \item Why do heartless people exist?
    \item Can we describe physics in compact form?
    \item What is gravity?
    \item What is matter?
    \item What is heat?
    \item What is love?
    \item Will two straight parallel lines stay parallel?
    \item Is exact cloning possible?
    \item Is teleportation possible?
    \item Can we travel as fast as we want?
    \item What is the meaning of life?
\end{enumerate}

We came from the stars. That is poetic, yet true, yet vague statement. 

\begin{comment}

And here are some open ones.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What happens if we squeeze stuff more and more?
    \item Is there a consistent axiom set for all mathematics? (?)
    \item Can we travel to the past?
    \item What was in the beginnign of the Big Bang and,
    if it's legitimate to ask, before it?
    \item What is our, life's and our Universe's faith?
    \item Is is possible to answer these questions without
    fucking one's brain up?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{We came from the stars.} That poetic verse? is how I answer the first one. But why would you believe me? Maybe you think I’m a good-willing guy, and you believe I wouldn’t lie to you. But even if that’s true, I may have mistaken and given you incorrect information accidentally.

Luckily, I can do better. I can <em>reason</em>. I can guide you so that you will understand, and you will end up thinking, ’we came from the stars’. Actually, you’ll end up with a much detailed picture, and you’ll end up there by your own thinking. There’s no need for you to believe me, no need for you to trust me. 

To be honest, I hope you do believe me in one thing: that you should read on. But if someone else has said that to you and you believe him or her, then you don’t need to believe me even about that. You don’t need to believe me at all, and that’s nice: it’s a damn heavy burden to take responsibility of truth. A person with a 1000-pound rock tied to the back only has theoretical freedom.

In this book I’ll build answers to questions in the list. Some will get a definite ’yes’ or ’no’ answer. Some will get more wordy, yet comprehensive answers. Some will be left open. I’ll discuss such questions so that you can get started, if you wish to find an answer.

More precisely, I mostly use common knowledge on which we all agree, like ’an apple likes to fall down to ground’. I use mathematics which makes common sense and which you can verify through Internet, and in some cases I quote empirical research supported by the strong consensus. If there’s a possibility of a flaw, I’ll point that out.

The questions may seem to be very different in their kinds. Some are mathematical, some consider natural science, and some are about humanity. According to the reader, some may be ridiculous, boring, impossible or philosophical. This book will show that these questions are, or with a little reformulation can be made, well-posed and answerable with the common sense we use for everyday purposes like deciding how to pack stuff in a backpack.

The road will be long and difficult. Populism isn’t of help here—we need to work through logic, computability theory, mathematics like topology, algebra, analysis and probability, physical theories like quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and relativity, and empirical data from cosmology, biology and psychology.

\chapter{Numbers}

We all use some math: numbers. To get into them, we start from sets. The set of living people, the set of grains of salt in a jar, the set of up and down, which we might denote by \(\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace\). % määritelmiä ja merkintöjä kuten unioni, leikkaus, functio yms.

\section{Counting things}

An elementary question about any set is, ``how many elements it has?'' The answer is called the cardinality of the set. For instance, the cardinality of \(\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace\), denoted by \(|\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace|\), is two. If two sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the same cardinality, we can put the elements of \(A\) in one-to-one correspondence with the elementes of \(B\), in other words, there's a bijective function \(f:A\rightarrow B\). %If \(\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace\) and \(B=\lbrace\leftarrow,\rightarrow\rbrace\),

This also works the other way around: if there's a bijection between \(A\) and \(B\), then \(|A|=|B|\). If there's a surjection from \(A\) to \(B\), then \(|A|\geq|B|\), and if there's an injection from \(A\) to \(B\), then \(|A|\leq|B|\). If there are both an injection and a surjection from \(A\) to \(B\), then \(|A|=|B|\), and there also is a bijection between \(A\) and \(B\).

A picture\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection\%2C_injection_and_surjection}} makes these points clear, at least if \(A\) and \(B\) are finite. They also hold for infinite sets, but reasoning is more difficult. It for example takes some effort to show that if there's a surjection and an injection from \(A\) to \(B\), then there's also a bijection between them.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr\%C3\%B6der\%E2\%80\%93Bernstein_theorem}}

The possible cardinalities of finite sets, \(0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(3\) and so on, are mathematical objects called natural numbers. They form another set called \(\NN\). It is an infinite set of which cardinality is denoted by \(\aleph_0\).

If we also count backwards from \(0\), we get
\begin{eqna}
    \ZZ=\lbrace\dotsc,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dotsc\rbrace,
\end{eqna}
the set of integers. We end up with integers when we construct a set of results to every subtraction of natural numbers. There's a bijection between \(\ZZ\) and \(\NN\): by ordering the integers into a sequence
\begin{eqna}
    0,1,-1,2,-2,3,\dotsc
\end{eqna}
we can put them in one-to-one correspondence with \(\NN\). Therefore  \(|\ZZ|=\aleph_0\).

If we can count the elements of a set \(X\) by using \(\NN\), then \(X\) is said to be countable. To be precice, \(X\) is countable if there is a surjection \(f:\NN\rightarrow X\), that is, \(|X|\leq\aleph_0\). Finite sets and \(\aleph_0\) sets are countable.

Given any set \(X\), we can form a set of all its subsets. That set is called the power set of \(X\) and is denoted by \(2^X\). For example,
\begin{eqna}
    2^{\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace}=\lbrace\emptyset,\lbrace\uparrow\rbrace,\lbrace\downarrow\rbrace,\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace\rbrace,
\end{eqna}
in which \(\emptyset=\lbrace\,\rbrace\) denotes the empty set.

We have
\begin{eqna}
    |\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace|=2<4=|2^{\lbrace\uparrow,\downarrow\rbrace}|.
\end{eqna}
This seems plausible: there's much more possibilities in choosing elements from any set \(X\) than it has elements, so \(|X|<|2^X|\). Actually, if \(X\) is finite, then \(|2^X|=2^{|X|}\), since each element of \(X\) contributes a factor of two to the number of possible subsets.

We can also show this more carefully. Let \(X\) be any set, finite or infinite, and take any function \(f:X\rightarrow 2^X\). Then form a set
\begin{eqna}
    D=\lbrace x\in X: x\notin f(x)\rbrace.
\end{eqna}
The notation on the right means ``all real numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) is not in \(f(x)\).'' Is there a \(x\in X\) so that \(f(x)=D\)? If \(x\in f(x)\), then by the construction of \(D\) we have \(x\notin D\) and therefore \(f(x)\neq D\), and if \(x\notin f(x)\), then by the construction of \(D\) we have \(x\in D\), so \(f(x)\neq D\). In either case \(f(x)\neq D\), so \(f\) is not a surjection.

Since \(f\) was arbitrary, there's no surjection from \(X\) to \(2^X\), and so \(|X|<|2^X|\). We denote \(|2^X|\) by \(2^{|X|}\), which is in line with the corresponding result for finite sets.

This means that there are infinities of different sizes, so to speak. Actually, we have infinitely many of them:
\begin{eqna}
    \NN,\: 2^\NN,\: 2^{2^\NN},\:2^{2^{2^\NN}},\: \dotsc
\end{eqna}

Now take \(X\) to be the set of all sets. Such a set contains all its subset, so \(2^X\subset X\). This means that \(|2^X|\leq|X|\). We seem to have a contradiction here. The ``set of all sets'' is a problematic concept and we shall not use it.

Another too peculiar set is
\begin{eqna}
    R=\lbrace x:x\notin x\rbrace.
\end{eqna}
Does it hold that \(R\in R\)? If so, then by the definition of \(R\) we have \(R\notin R\)---and the other way around. This is a problem called Russel's paradox. The pradox can also be put in everyday language:
\begin{quote}
    In a village there's a man called Russell. He maintains GNU+Linux systems of some villagers. To be more specific, Russell maintains the GNU+Linux system of every villager who doesn't maintain their own system. An unsolved riddle puzzles the villagers: does Russell maintain his own GNU+Linux system?
\end{quote}
If Russel maintains his own system, then he maintains the system of a person who maintains his own system, sot that can't be true. On the other hand, if don't do that, then he does not maintain the system of every veillager not maintaining their own system.

The resolution of this parctical version is simple: no such Russell exists. In the same way, the set \(R\) does not exist. Russell, \(R\) and the set of all sets demonstrate that some caution is needed in defining sets.

Back to numbers. We can define natural numbers in terms of sets:
\begin{eqna}
    0=\emptyset,\quad 1=\lbrace0\rbrace,\quad2=\lbrace0,1\rbrace,\quad3=\lbrace0,1,2\rbrace
\end{eqna}
and so on. Every number is founded? on \(\emptyset\), for example
\begin{eqna}
    3=\lbrace\emptyset,\lbrace\emptyset\rbrace,\lbrace\lbrace\emptyset\rbrace\rbrace\rbrace.
\end{eqna}
For any natural number \(n\) it holds that \(n+1=n\cup\lbrace n\rbrace\). In this sense we can think of \(\NN\) as another number! In this context it is denoted by \(\omega\).  We can count even further:
\begin{eqna}
    \omega+1=\omega\cup\lbrace\omega\rbrace=\lbrace1,2,3,\dotsc,\lbrace1,2,3,\dotsc\rbrace\rbrace.
\end{eqna}
Numbers formed this way are called ordinals. \(\omega\) is the first infinite ordinal. At first it seems obvious that ordinals form a set \(O\). But \(O\) is also an ordinal number, just like \(\NN\), and therefore is also \(O+1=O\cup\lbrace O\rbrace\). On the other hand, \(O+1\in O\), but that seems weird; for example \(3\notin 2\). The set of all ordinals is flawed in the same way as the set of all sets.

This naive set theory doesn't work well for studying these issues. In more advanced treatments ordinals form so-called proper class, as do all sets?. Proper classes are ``too large'' to be sets.

If we place all integers equidistantly in a row which extends infinitely far both left and right, we get a sketch of the number line. The number line symbolizes size, distance, amount and other continuous quantities. \(\ZZ\) only forms a sparse part of the whole line. If we take all the points, we get \(\RR\), the set of real numbers, also called the continuum. Let's take a question from the list presented in the first chapter.
\begin{quote}
    Can we order the points of a line?
\end{quote}
More precicely, can we put all the real numbers in a row so that each \(x\in\RR\) always has a definite successor? The real number line clearly is not such a row---what would be the successor of \(0\) on the line? \(0.1\)? No, since there are real numbers between \(0\) and \(0.1\). To my personal intuition the task seems difficult. There's too many numbers in \(\RR\), I think.

On the other hand, if \(\RR\) is countable, we can order it by simply counting its elements.

Many points along the number line can be expressed as fractions, in the form \(x=\frac{m}{n}\) in which \(m,n\in\ZZ\). Such numebers are called rational numbers and their set is denoted by \(\QQ\). Between any two rational numbers \(q_1=\frac{m_1}{n_1}\) and \(q_2=\frac{m_2}{n_2}\), no matter how close to each other they are, there is another rational number
\begin{eqna}
    q_3=\frac{1}{2}q_1+\frac{1}{2}q_2=\frac{m_1n_2+m_2n_1}{2n_1n_2}.
\end{eqna}
Rational numbers are therefore very densely spaced on the number line. It seems that ordering \(\QQ\) is as difficult as ordering \(\RR\).

Consider the the Cartesian product \(\ZZ\times\ZZ\doteq\ZZ^2\), the set of ordered pairs \((m,n)\) in which \(m,n\in\ZZ\). We can form a function \(f:\ZZ^2\rightarrow\QQ\) which takes \((m,n)\mapsto\frac{m}{n}\), unless \(n=0\), in wich case we may define \((m,n)\mapsto 0\). Some pairs map to same rational numbers, for example \((1,2)\mapsto\frac{1}{2}\) and \((2,4)\mapsto\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\), but for each \(q\in\QQ\) there is some pair that maps to it. In other words, \(f\) is a surjection and \(|\QQ|\leq|\ZZ^2|\). If we can count \(\ZZ^2\), we can also count \(\QQ\).

To count \(\ZZ^2\), draw a square grid in which the first \(\ZZ\) acts as the horizontal and the second as the vertical coordinate. Then start from the origin and spiral away to infinity. The resulting sequence,
\begin{eqna}
    (0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,1),(-1,0),\dotsc% piirrä kuva
\end{eqna}
defines a bijection \(f:\NN\rightarrow\ZZ^2\).

Here we have four infinite sets, \(\NN\subset\ZZ\subset\QQ\) and \(\ZZ^2\), each of them having cardinality \(\aleph_0\). If \(\RR\) is more or less like \(\QQ\), perhaps equal to it, then we can also count and order it. %Is there an infinite set X with |X| < aleph_0 ?

Let's investigate the issue. Take the interval
\begin{eqna}
    I=[0,1[\;\doteq\lbrace x\in\RR : 0\leq x<1\rbrace.
\end{eqna}
There's a surjection from \(I\) to \(\RR\) (take for example \(]0,1[\,\subset I\), stretch it to fill the whole \(\RR\) by a \(\tan(x)\)-like function and map \(0\) to \(0\)) and an injection (the trivial \(x\mapsto x\)), so \(|I|=|\RR|\). To find the cardinality of \(\RR\) it is enough to study \(I\).

Any \(x\in I\) is either smaller than \(\frac{1}{2}\) or greater or equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\), so it belongs to either \([0,\frac{1}{2}[\) or \([\frac{1}{2},1[\), that is, it belongs either to the forst or the socond half of \(I\). Say \(x\in[0,\frac{1}{2}[\). Then we can ask the same question again: is \(x\) in \([0,\frac{1}{4}[\) or \([\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}[\)? This time \(x\) was found in the right interval. We continue and get an infinite sequense, ``left, right\ldots'', or \((\leftarrow,\rightarrow,\dotsc)\).

Therefore, for any \(x\in I\) we have an infinite sequence \(S_x\) of \(\leftarrow\)'s and \(\rightarrow\)'s. On the other hand, any such sequence determines an \(x\in I\)---if we turn any arrow around in the sequence, the corresponding number changes. Each sequence corresponds to exactly one \(x\in I\). We have constructed a bijection between \(I\) and the set of sequences \(S_x\).

Furthermore, a sequence \(S_x\) defines a subset of \(\NN\) if we take \(\rightarrow\) to mean ``does belong to the subset'' and \(\leftarrow\) to ``doesn't''. For example the sequence \((\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\leftarrow,\dotsc)\), with all the rest being \(\leftarrow\)'s, corresponds to the set \(\lbrace0,2\rbrace\). Therefore we've constructed a bijection between the sequences \(S_x\) and \(2^\NN\).

Putting these together, we have \(|\RR|=2^{|\NN|}\). \(\QQ\neq\RR\); \emph{\(\RR\) is uncountable.} Even though we could order \(\QQ\) by counting it using \(\NN\), we can't do the same to \(\RR\). Anyway, at least in principle there may be some other way to order \(\RR\).

Is there a set \(X\) such that \(\aleph_0<|X|<2^{\aleph_0}\)? So-called continuum hypothesis states that no such \(X\) exists. Is continuum hypothesis true is a sublte issue. Fortunately, it rarely matters. In most cases all that mattes is that is a set finite, countably infinite or uncountable.

%\begin{eqna}
    

%For any function \(f:\NN\mapsto\mathcal{S}\) we can form a table of the following form:
%\begin{eqna}
%\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
    %%%x_0 & \leftarrow  & \rightarrow & \leftarrow  & \leftarrow  & \cdots \\
    %x_1 & \leftarrow  & \leftarrow  & \leftarrow  & \rightarrow & \cdots \\
    %x_2 & \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \cdots \\
    %x_3 & \leftarrow  & \rightarrow & \leftarrow  & \leftarrow  & \cdots \\
    %\vdots & \vdots   & \vdots      & \vdots      & \vdots      & \ddots
%%\end{array}
%\end{eqna}
%Now, take the sequence that has appered on the diagonal and turn each of its arrows around. In this case we would get
%\begin{eqna}
    %(\rightarrow,\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\rightarrow,\dotsc).
%\end{eqna}
%Is this sequence somewhere in the table? No! If you try to fit it into the table, the arrow on the diagonal will always point into the wrong direction. Therefore, \(f\) is not a surjection. Since \(f\) was arbitrary, this means that there is no surjection from \(\NN\) to \(\mathcal{S}\) and so \(|\mathcal{S}|>\aleph_0\). The sets \(\mathcal{S}\), \(I\), \(\RR\) and \(2^\NN\) are uncountable and their cardinality is denoted by \(2^{\aleph_0}\), in line with the face that for a finite set \(X\) we have \(|2^X|=2^{|X|}\).
%
%We've seen that the power set of infinite \(\NN\) is strictly greater than \(\NN\) and that our speculation that every infinite set had cardinality \(\aleph_0\) was wrong. Instead, there are at least two infinities of different sizes: the countable \(\NN\) and the uncountable \(\RR\). We can't order real numbers by counting them with natural numbers.
%
%Actually, we can show that for any set \(X\) it holds that \(|X|<|2^X|\). Take any function \(f:X\rightarrow 2^X\). Then form a set
%\begin{eqna}
    %Y=\lbrace x\in X: x\notin f(x)\rbrace.
%\end{eqna}
%Is there a \(x\in X\) so that \(f(x)=Y\)? If \(x\in f(x)\), then by the construction of \(Y\) we have \(x\notin Y\) and therefore \(f(x)\neq Y\), and if \(x\notin f(x)\), then by the construction of \(Y\) we have \(x\in Y\), so \(f(x)\neq Y\). In either case \(f(x)\neq Y\), so \(f\) is not a surjection. Since \(f\) was arbitrary, there's no surjection from \(X\) to \(2^X\), and so \(|X|<|2^X|\).

%Let's collect the results. We have
%\begin{eqna}
    %|\NN|=|\ZZ|=|\ZZ^2|=|\QQ|=\aleph_0<|I|=|\RR|=|2^{\NN}|=2^{\aleph_0}.
%\end{eqna}






%Now assume that we have an ordered subset \((x_0,x_1,x_2\) of \(I\). We can put the corresponding sequences in a table:
%\begin{tabular}{c | c c c c}
    %\(x_0\) & \leftarrow & \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \cdots \\
    %\(x_0\) & \leftarrow & \rightarrow & \rightarrow & \cdots
%\end{tabular}
%\begin{eqna}
    %yeah
%\end{eqna}
%If we now take the sequence on the diagonal and turn each of its arrows around, we get another sequence and the corresponding number. In this example listing it would be \((\rightarrow,\rightarrow,\leftarrow,\dotsc)\). Is this number listed? No! It can't be anywhere in the listing, since the arrow that happens to be on the diagonal is turned around.

%So, given any listing of real numbers on the line \(I\), there's a number that isn't listed. In other words, we can't order \(I\) like we can order natural numbers and fractions---we can't count them. It's said that \(\NN\), \(\ZZ\) and fractions, or rational numbers, denoted by \(\QQ\), are countable, and \(I\) is uncountable. And, because \(I\subset\RR\), also \(\RR\) is uncountable. %we can identify the arrow lists to subsets of N and therefore see that R is of the same cardinality of 2^R. I should show that I is of the same cardinality as R, althoug it seems obvious. Furthermore, power set is always larger than the original and so the set of all sets seems problematic.

%Let's compare \(\QQ\) and \(\RR\). They're similar in the sense that they both are dense. This fact may trick intuition to assume that \(\QQ=\RR\). But sinse \(\RR\) is uncountable, it is larger than countable \(\QQ\). \(\RR\) has a larger cardinality than \(\QQ\), so our earlier notion that all infinite sets have cardinality \(\infty\) was flawed. The cardinaluty of \(\QQ\) is 

%\(\ZZ\) is also countable: it's easy to find a bijection to \(\NN\), it's just \((0,1,-1,2,-2,\dotsc)\). The cardinalities of two sets are same, if there is a bijection between them. The cardinality of all infinite countable sets is denoted by \(\aleph_0\). The cardinality of \(\RR\) is denoted by \(\mathfrak{c}\).

%So the answer to the question if we can order the points of a line is:
%\begin{quote}
    %We cannot count points on a line by putting them in a corresponence with natural numbers \(0,1,2\) and so on. This is because \(\RR\) is an uncountable set. However, if we assume that we can always choose elements from sets, that is we embrace the Axiom of Choice, then we can prove that there exist an order in which every point has a definite successor.
%\end{quote}

\section{Rationals, reals or something more?}

The uncountability of \(\RR\) may seem peculiar. You might ask, ``wouldn't \(\QQ\) be enough for all practical purposes?'' One discomfortable property of any countable subsetset \(X=\lbrace x_i\in\RR : i\in\NN\rbrace\) of \(\RR\) like \(\QQ\) is that we can cover it using almost nothing. To do it, take a collection \(\lbrace I_i : i\in\NN\rbrace\) of intervals
\begin{eqna}
    I_0=\left[x_0,x_0+\tfrac{1}{2}c\right],\quad I_1=[x_1,x_1+\tfrac{1}{4}c],\,\dotsc
\end{eqna}
with \(c\in\RR\). The intervals clearly cover \(X\); in symbols,
\begin{eqna}
    X\subset\bigcup_{i\in\NN}I_i.
\end{eqna}
The length of the interval halves every time we go one step further in the sequence \(I_i\). The first interval has length \(\frac{1}{2}c\), the second \(\frac{1}{4}c\) and so on. If we juxtapose all these \(I_i\)'s in a row, we get a line that looks like
\begin{eqna}
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.6666\textwidth}
    \begin{picture}(1,0.025)

Their sum is exaclty \(c\). The Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea was worried that if you are about to travel to a neighboring village, you muts first get halfway there. But to get halfway there, you must get quarter of the way there, and so on, \emph{ad infinitum}.

So, even though the number line is infinitely long and rational numbers are densely spaced on it, we can cover them with lines of which combined length is \(c\) which can be anything, for example \(\frac{1}{1000}\). This sounds paradoxal, but it should be kept in mind that had we used a finite collection of lines to cover \(\QQ\), then their combined length would have necessarily been \(\infty\).%any uncountable sum of positive terms is necessarily infinite?

It is said that \(\QQ\) is a set of measure\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure}} zero. \(\QQ\) is small in both the sense of cardinality and of measure; like \(\ZZ\), it's only a tiny portion of \(\RR\). We should expect to meet irrational numebers in practical situations.

Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse \(c\) of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the opposite two sides \(a\) and \(b\). By calculating the area of the big square
\begin{eqna}
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.5\textwidth}

        \put(0.2222,0){\line(1,2){0.1111}}
        \put(0,0.1111){\line(2,-1){0.2222}}
    \end{picture}\nonumber
\end{eqna}
in two different ways, we get
\begin{eqna}
    (a+b)^2=4\left(\frac{1}{2}ab\right)+c^2
\end{eqna}
from which it follows that
\begin{eqna}
    a^2+b^2=c^2.
\end{eqna}
Applying this we get that the length of the diagonal of a unit square is equal to \(\sqrt{2}\). If we had
\begin{eqna}
    \sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}
\end{eqna}
for some \(m,n\in\ZZ\), then it would hold that
\begin{eqna}
    2n^2=m^2,
\end{eqna}
in other words, \(m^2\) would be an even integer. The square of an odd integer is always odd, so also \(m\) would have to be even, that is, of the form \(m=2k\), \(k\in\ZZ\). We get
\begin{eqna}
    2n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2,
\end{eqna}
so also \(n\) is even, of the form \(n=\tilde{k}\). Now we can eliminate the \(2\)'s and get another fractional representation of \(\sqrt{2}\).

But this is supposed to work with any fractional representation of \(\sqrt{2}\), including the one from which we have already eliminated all common factors. This is a contradiction and the only possibility is that \(\sqrt{2}\) has no fractional representation at all; in other words, it is irrational.

The numerical value of \(\sqrt{2}\) is approximately \(1.4\). Other important irrational numbers include the circle constant \(\tau\approx6.3\)\footnote{The circle constant \(\tau=2\pi\) is the circumference of a circle of radius \(1\). Even though \(\tau\) is more natural choice, for historical reasons \(2\pi\) is used widely. See \url{http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto}.} and Euler's number \(\ee\approx2.7\). I don't know how to show they're irrational.

Without \(\RR\) differential calculus would be difficult. There's no problem in defining derivative of a function \(f:\QQ\rightarrow\QQ\), but that derivative would have peculiar properties. Consider for example the function
\begin{eqna}
    f(x)=\begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if}\: x < \sqrt{2} \\
        1 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{eqna}
Because \(\sqrt{2}\), the point of abrupt change in \(f\), is not in \(\QQ\), the function would be differntiable everywhere in \(\QQ\), the derivative being identically zero. In \(\QQ\) the fundamental theorem of calculus\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus}} would not hold good.

Furthermore, many simple differential equation like \(f'=f\) are unsolvable in \(\QQ\). The solution to that equation is the exponential function \(f(x)=\ee^x\), which form many \(x\in\QQ\) does not give a rational number, for example \(\ee^1=\ee\). We really need \(\RR\).

Is \(\RR\) enough? Consider equation
\begin{eqna}
    x^2=-1.
\end{eqna}
There's no real number that would solve it. Anyway, we can define so-called imaginary unit \(\ii\) as a special number that solves the equation. Naturally also \(-\ii\) solves it. Now we have new numbers, each of them of the form \(z=a+\ii\,b\) with \(a,b\in\RR\), called complex numbers. Real number multiplication and the property \(\ii^2=-1\) determines the genera complex number product %imaginary unit is a 'rotation operator'
\begin{eqnb}
    z_1z_2&=&(a_1+\ii\,b_1)(a_2+\ii\,b_2)\nonumber\\
    &=&a_1a_2+a_1\,\ii\,b_2+\ii\,b_1a_2+\ii^2b_1b_2\nonumber\\
    &=&a_1a_2-b_1b_2+\ii\,(a_1b_2+b_1a_2).\label{complexnumberproduct}
\end{eqnb}
The set of complex numbers is denoted by \(\CC\). Any polynomial has a solution in \(\CC\).

\(\CC\) is clearly bijective to \(\RR^2\). Indeed, a more careful definition of \(\CC\) starts from \(\RR^2\) and explicitly defines the product \eqref{complexnumberproduct} for pairs \((a,b)\in\RR^2\). We then have \(0=(0,0)\), 1=\((1,0)\), \(\ii=(0,1)\) and so on.

It's useful to picture complex numbers as a plane. The imaginary unit \(\ii\) then acts as a rotation operator: it rotates \(\ii\) and \(1\) by \(\frac{1}{4}\tau\) counter-clockwise, an
 
This also holds for any complex number:
\begin{eqna}
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.12\textwidth}
    \begin{picture}(3,1)
        \put(0,0){\line(1,0){0.333333}}
        \put(0,0){\line(0,1){1}}
        \put(1,0.5){\vector(1,0){0.5}}
        \put(1.1,0.6){\(\cdot\ii\)}
    \end{picture}\nonumber
\end{eqna}

We can express a complex number \(z\) not only as a pair of Cartesian coordinates \((a_x,b_z)\) but also as a pair of polar coordinates \((\theta_z,|z|)\). Here \(\theta\) is the angle that a line drawn from \(0\) to \(z\) makes with the line drawn from \(0\) to \(1\) and \(|z|\) is the distance of \(z\) from \(0\), which is also called the norm of \(z\). By Pythagorean theorem%theta -> theta_z
\begin{eqna}
    |z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}.
\end{eqna}

In polar coordinates the multiplication of complex numbers becomes very simple:
\begin{eqna}
    (\theta_{z_1},|z_1|)\cdot(\theta_{z_2},|z_2|)=(\theta_{z_1}+\theta_{z_2},|z_1||z_2|).
\end{eqna}
Multiplicating \(z\) by a complex number of unit norm just rotates \(z\) in the complex plane.

Consider the exponential function with an imaginary argument, that is, with an argument of the form \(z=\ii x\) with \(x\in\RR\). What it should mean is not obvious, but in order to make sense it should at least have the properties
\begin{eqna}
    \ee^{\ii x}=\left(\ee^\ii\right)^x\qquad\text{and}\qquad\ee^{\ii\cdot0}=1
\end{eqna}
of the ordinary exponential function. Requiring these properties and defining \(\ee^\ii=(\varphi,1)\) for some \(\varphi\), then
\begin{eqna}
    \ee^{\ii x}=(\varphi,1)(\varphi,1)\dotsb=(x\cdot\varphi,1),
\end{eqna}
at least if \(x\in\NN\). In other words, \(x\) acts as a parameter which rotates \(\ee^{\ii\,x}\) around the unit circle of the complex plane. By choosing \(\varphi\) in an appropriate way we get
\begin{eqna}
    \ee^{\ii x}=\cos(x)+\ii\sin(x).
\end{eqna}
This is called Euler's formula.

The only reasonable and used definition of \(\ee^{z}\) with \(z\in\CC\) yhtyy to this. It is
\begin{eqna}
    \ee^{z}=\ee^{|z|}(\cos(x)+\ii\sin(x)).
\end{eqna}
This is equal to the power series
\begin{eqna}
    \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{z^n}{n!},
\end{eqna}
the Taylor series of \(\ee^{x}\) with \(x\in\RR\).

Euler's formula is of great help since it lets us use the exponential function instead of trigonometric ones which are much more difficult to handle.

Some subsets of \(\CC\) have fascinating properties. Consider a sequence \(z_n\) defined by starting from \(z_0=0\) and calculating the rest by the formula
\begin{eqna}
    z_{n+1}=z_n^2+c
\end{eqna}
in which \(c\in\CC\) is some constant. Now we can ask, does this sequence diverge away from zero, or will it circulate somewhere near it forever? This obviously depends on \(c\). The Mandelbrot set, denoted by \(M\), is the set of complex numbers \(c\) for which the sequence does not diverge to infinity. Figure \ref{mandelbrot_picture} shows a picture of \(M\).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,trim={230 530 570 530},clip]{graphics/mandelbrot.jpg}
    \caption{The Mandelbrot set \(M\). Points \(z\in M\) are colored black. Other points are colored according to their estimated distances to \(\partial M\).}
    \label{mandelbrot_picture}
\end{figure}

The mandelbrot set is a fractal, which means that by zooming into the set similar patterns appearagain and again. A video\footnote{\url{https://vimeo.com/12185093}} shows zooming into the border of \(M\), ednoted by \(\partial M\), eventually reaching a zoom factor of \(2^{760}\). The video is not art nor kitsch; it is a visualisation of \(M\) created solely out of its definition. The colors indicate how fast the sequence corresponding to a point \(c\notin M\) diverges. (The music is not generated from the definition of \(M\).)

According to a 1991 publication\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9201282}} by M. Shishikura, the Hausdorff dimension of \(\partial M\) is two. The precise definition of Hausdorff dimension is complicated, but it can be understood intuitively.

When measuring the volume of a set in \(\RR^3\), we cover the set with small balls and add their volumes together. The smaller balls we use, the more precise estimate of the volume we get. A simple fat object has positive volume. On the other hand, its border which is a thin object has zero volume. This is because the volume of a ball is proportional to the cube of its radius \(r\) but the number of balls needed is proportional to \(r^2\), and as we use smaller and smaller balls the estimate of the volume goes to zero.

However, we can measure the area of the border by artificially changing the formula for calculating the volume of a ball from being proportional to \(r^3\) to being proportional to \(r^2\). If we want to calculate the length of a wire-like object, we use \(r^1\). If you use too low \(x\) in \(r^x\), you get \(\infty\), and isf you use too high \(x\), you get \(0\). Each set has its own correct \(x\), the Hausdorff dimension of the set.

Sets we study usually have \(x\in\NN\). The Hausdorff dimensions of a fat, thin and a wire-like object are \(3\), \(2\) and \(1\). For a simple set \(X\) the Hausdorff dimension of \(\partial X\) is less than the one of \(X\) by one. An esoteric set may have non-integer Hausdorff dimension. 

\(M\) and \(\partial M\) has the same Hausdorff dimension, two. It means that \(\partial M\) is infinitely long and extremely wrinkled. It implies that no matter how deep we zoom into \(\partial M\), we will always see complex patterns.

We now have the countable sets \(\NN\), \(\ZZ\) and \(\QQ\) of cardinality \(\aleph_0\), uncountable sets \(\RR\) and \(\CC\) of cardinality \(2^{\aleph_0}\), proper classes \(O\) and \(\lbrace x: x\;\text{is a set}\rbrace\) and the nonexisting \(\lbrace{x:x\notin x\rbrace}\).

\section{Rigor}

Earlier in this chapter I used reasoning of variable rigorouseness. I explained Hausdorff dimension quickly and showed \(|X|<|2^X|\) somewhat carefully. It's always a tradeoff: more rigor and you get more solid results. Less rigor and you can tackle a wider set of problems. Another question from the beginning illustrates the point:
\begin{quote}
    Is it possible to comb a hairy ball?
\end{quote}
As Figure \ref{combing_hairy_ball} shows, combing a hairy ball necessarily fails at least at one point. A cowlick is necessary. No rigor is needed. Anyway, what if the ball has some other dimension? A circle
\begin{eqna}
    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.1\textwidth}
    \begin{picture}(1,1)
        \put(0.5,0.5){\circle{1}}
    \end{picture}\nonumber
\end{eqna}
can obviously be combed without cowlicks. Still no rigor needed. Anyway, in other dimensions the situation changes.

Let's start from defining the circle, or one-dimensional sphere, denoted by \(S^1\). It is a subset of \(\RR^2\) of points which all have the same distance to some specific point. Choosing this point to be the origin and the radius being one, we can, with the aid of the Pythagorean Theorem, define \(S^1\subset\RR^2\) as those points \(x_1,x_2\) for which
\begin{eqna}
    x_1^2+x_2^2=1.
\end{eqna}
A little geometry and another use of the Pythagorean Theorem shows that \(S^2\), that is the border of usual origin-centric ball of radious one, can be definied analoguously, as a subset of \(\RR^3\) of points \(x_1,x_2,x_3\) for which it holds that
\begin{eqna}
    x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1.
\end{eqna}
In general, \(S^n\subset\RR^{n+1}\) is the set of points for which
\begin{eqna}
    \sum_{i=1}^nx_n^2=1.
\end{eqna}
Here it took some rigor to define \(n\)-dimensional sphere. Which are the values of \(n\) for which the combing can be done without cowlicks? This is a highly nontrivial question and requires rigorous mathematics.

One good reason for being rigorous is generality. If we define a mathematical concept carefully, that is, we choose so-called axioms, and prove results following from those axioms equally carefully, we get a robust sets of theorems that hold \emph{always when the axioms hold}. By being once rigorous, we get solid data of any system that satisfies the axioms.

A very useful example of strictly defined mathematical concept is a group. It is a set \(G\) and a binary operation \(*:G\times G\rightarrow G\) which together satisfy the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Associativity: for all \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\in G\) it holds that
    \begin{eqna}
        (a*b)*c=a*(b*c).
    \end{eqna}
    \item Identity element: there is an element \(e\in G\) such that for any \(a\in G\) it holds that
    \begin{eqna}
        e*a=a*e=e.
    \end{eqna}
    \item Inverse element: for any \(a\in G\) there is an element \(a^{-1}\in G\) for which it holds that
    \begin{eqna}
        a^{-1}a=a\,a^{-1}=e.
    \end{eqna}
\end{itemize}
Now we can prove carefully results that hold for any group.
\begin{teoreema}
The identity element of a group is unique.
\end{teoreema}
\begin{proof}
Let \(e\) and \(\tilde{ei}\) be identity elements. Since \(e\) is an identity, it holds that \(e*\tilde{e}=\tilde{e}\), and since \(\tilde{e}\) is an identity, it holds that \(e*\tilde{e}=e\). Therefore \(\tilde{e}=e*\tilde{e}=e\).
\end{proof}

We have already met groups. For example \(\ZZ\) with the normal addition \(+\) is a group in which \(e=0\) and \(n^{-1}=-1\). Als \(\RR\) is a group with \(+\). If we remove \(0\) from \(\RR\), it becomes a group with the normal multiplication \(\cdot\) the identity being \(1\) and inverse \(x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}\). Also \(\lbrace\CC\setminus\lbrace{0}\rbrace,\cdot\rbrace\) is a group. The identity is \(1\) and the inverse is
\begin{eqna}
    (\theta_z,|z|)^{-1}=(-\theta_z,\tfrac{1}{|z|}).
\end{eqna}

These groups are commutative or abelian, meaning that \(a*b=b*a\). Commutativity of a group is not a theorem: there exists nonabelian groups. An important examples are rotation groups \(\mathrm{SO}(n)\) with \(n\geq3\). \(\mathrm{SO}(n)\) consists of maps \(R:\RR^n\rightarrow\RR^n\) which keep the distance of a point from the origin untouched and do not mirror.%Why is this noncommutative?

The configuration of a physical object, for example a stone, can be described by a point in \(\RR^3\), which corresponds to location, and an element in \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\). Ignoring location, we chooose some reference stone and tell how much the actual stone has rotated with respect to the reference, which fixes the \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\).

When we change the configuration of the stone---keeping it in hands while turning it in this way and that---we draw a path in \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\). Now we can ask an interesting question: is \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) simply connected? A space being simply connected means that any loop can be continuously shrinked to a point. \(\RR^2\) is connected but \(\RR^2\setminus\lbrace0\rbrace\) is not, since a loop around the hole left by removing \(0\) cannot be shrinked.

The question may sound difficult, but the answer can be found without rigor. The method is called Dirac's belt trick. A path in \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) can be parameterised with a belt. We get a loop if both ends of the belt are in the same configuration. We can deform loops just moving the belt while keeping the ends in the same configuration (but not necessarily in the same locations).

A unit path is a path which starts from the identity and does not rotate at all, in other words, a completely straight belt. Now, take the other end and rotate it by \(\tau\). Now you have a loop which starts from and ends at identity, but which does something in the middle. Try to deform that that into the identity. You'll find that you can't. \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) is not simply connected.

If you take the straight belt and you twist the other end by \(2n\tau\), then you can deform it into the identity. There are two sets of loops: those that can be deformed to the identity and those that cannot. The latter ones can be deformed into each other.

This reasoning may not convince you perfectly. To be certain about the non-simply connectedness of \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) requires rigor. Furthermore, finding simply connected \(\mathrm{SO}(n)\)'s also requires rigor.

An \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\) rotation leaves \(S^2\) intact. There's a result called Banach-Tarski paradox according to whic \(S^2\) can be split into five parts and then construct from these pieces two whole \(S^2\)'s by just rotating the pieces, provided that we can always choose. This is highly counterintuitive result: doesn't rotation preserve area? How is it possible that splitting and rotating makes two out of one?

A question from the beginning:
\begin{quote}
    Can we always choose?
\end{quote}
More precisely, if we have a collection of nonempty sets \(X_i\), is there always a function \(f\) such that \(f(i)\in X_i\), or in other words, is a Cartesina product of nonempty sets always nonempty?%is this chice function correct?

It's tempting to answer yes. It seems obvious that choosing is always possible. Yet that assumption leads to absurd results like the Banach-Tarski paradox and well-ordering of any set. This question, together with the ``set'' of all sets, ordinal numbers and Russel's paradox motivates rigorous study of sets and leads to axiomatic set theory. So-called Axiom of Choice says that yes, we can always choose. It is an axiom, not a theorem.

%For example, a bent sheet of metal satisfies the definition of a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, so we know that it's curvature at any point can be characterized with two real numbers, and that curvature satisfies the Bianchi identities.
%do parallel lines continue to be parallel? parallel axiom. manifolds. results: curvature tensor, bianchi identities.
% rigor is pointless if the math is intuitive or if the starting point is vague. Or if the question is boring and someone else has worked it out.

%what's wrong with math and physics teaching

%An observation: People don't write their insights down. I often get an idea, and after explaining it to others, I her, that's obvious, didn't you understand it already? I ask, why haven't you told it me! I write it down, and it's fucking perfect.

\chapter{Building math}

Russel's paradox and other absurdities drove mathematics in a foundational crisis about a cantury ago. Thanks to logicians and set theorists, the crisis has now largely been solved. I start now from the very bottomi and aim to be as rigorous as possible.

Immediately a question arises: how rigorous can we be? Many would say, ``as rigorous as we want, it's just a question of patience.'' But how can we be sure about that? Maybe wa can't be completely rigorous. Let's see how far we can get.

\section{Empirical results}

By the very definition of our task, we have nothing to begin with. No math, no logic, no god. To be honest, I don't know how to tackel the problem if it really is interpreted that strictly. \emph{Tyhjästä ei voi nyhjäistä}, as we say here in Finland.

If a child was a \emph{tabula rasa}, he or she would not learn anything. But we people are born with a language instinct in our DNA. We are no tabula rasa. The same problem is encountered in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence: there's no general learning algorith; an algorith must always be crafted for the task it'll be used for. The ``no free lunch theorem'' of computer science gives some rigor to this notion.

Our \emph{tabula} has been written during millions of years of evolution of \emph{homo sapiens}. To get started, we must consider \emph{empirical data} of our very own thinking and try to model it. That's right: mathematics is not usually thought of as an empirical science, yet when we seek ultimate rigor, we need empirism?.

Of course, every time we do math, we use experience and data sought from the surroundings and past. We just do it instinctively, without noticing. Now we will be very explicit.

Think of a human being, say Jasmine, explaining some issue. That is our starting point. How does she do it? She talks, shows body language. It's all very vague, but we can strip off some less essential features of her presentation. It's a tradeoff: while we remove vagueness, the expressive power of the presentation goes down.

So we strip off body language and tone of voice. We change spoken language to text. The expressive power is still good---I've had deep discussions with Jasmine via just e-mail---but we can now say something definite about Jasmine's presentation: it's a finite string \(s_n\) of symbols from a finite alphabet \(A\). There's infinitely many presentations, but they are countable. (why? must be shown) There's less possible presentations than there are real numbers.

This reasoning is of course intuitive, informal, nonrigorous. It's metamathematics. We can't avoid it when seeking for rigorous foundations.

Written english is still somewhat vague. let's formalize more: a presentation can be split into sentences, each of them stating something. If Jasmine cares enough about getting her point through, she collects her conclusions into a few sentence in the end of her presentation.

Some terminology: if Jasmine reasoned correctly, her presentation is called a proof and her conclusions are a theorem. Since many sentences can be melted together, we can assume that a theorem is always a single sentence. A proof is useful to think of as a string of many sentences. Now the proof looks something like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
A sentence
another sentence
...
one more sentence
THEOREM
\end{lstlisting}
Proofs in mathematical literatures are exactly of this form.

This is still a little vague. What is a sentence? We can single out some especially important words from a proof, for example \lstinline!if!, \lstinline!then! and \lstinline!not!.

\section{Propositional logic}

Propositional logic is a formal system of reasoning which goes back to ancient Greece. In propositional logic we have some statements of fact (or fiction) like \lstinline!Frege_is_a_human!, and words like \lstinline!implies!, \lstinline!not!, \lstinline!and! and \lstinline!or!.

In set theory we might say something like this.
\begin{quote}
    If \(x\) is in \(A\) always means that \(x\) is not in \(B\), then \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint.
\end{quote}%vai tarvitanks tähän jo predikaattilogiikkaa?


 We could write for example the sentence
\begin{lstlisting}
(x_is_in_A implies not x_is_in_B) implies
    A_and_B_are_disjoint
\end{lstlisting}
The indentation on the second line means there's actually only one line and one sentence which just couldn't fit on the page.

We don't need all the words I listed---some can be expressed in terms of others. My choice is \lstinline!not! and \lstinline!implies! which I'll shorten to \lstinline[language=propositio]!N! and \lstinline[language=propositio]!I!. These are functionally complete\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness\#Minimal_functionally_complete_operator_sets}} as we'll see soon?. Actually, \lstinline!not_and! would solely be functionally complete, but using it it would make the theory a little more obscure.

For syntactical simplicity, let's not use parenthesis. Instead, let's write
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
I I x_is_in_A N x_is_in_B A_and_B_are_disjoint
\end{lstlisting}
This is unambiguous, because each \lstinline[language=propositio]!I! is followed by exactly two sentences and each \lstinline[language=propositio]!I! by exactly one sentence.

To be precise:
\begin{maaritelma}
A word of propositional logic is a finite, non-empty string of symbols from the alphabet
\begin{lstlisting}
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789_
\end{lstlisting}
not including the carriage return or space, which is not \lstinline[language=propositio]!I! or \lstinline[language=propositio]!N!.
\end{maaritelma}% there are countably infinite number of finite strings of symbols, and there for equally much sentences.
\begin{maaritelma}
A sentence of propositional logic is a finite string for which one of the following three conditions holds:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is a word
    \item It consists of \lstinline[language=propositio]!N!, a space and a sentence in that order
    \item It consists of \lstinline[language=propositio]!I!, a space, a sentence, a space and another sentence in that order.
\end{enumerate}
\end{maaritelma}
Precision is important because it allows us to let computers verufy things. This Python script verifies if sds is a sentence:
and 

%\lstinputlisting[language=python,basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily]{scripts/is_a_sentence.py}

%the definition points to itself, but that' no problem since the sring is finite. Its called recursion.

Now we have defined a sentence of propositional logice rigorously, so rigorously that even a computer may get it. Now some informal notation to make life easier. We use small letters to denote words and capital letters to denote sentences.

We write
\begin{eqna}
    C=A\rightarrow B
\end{eqna}
if \(C\) is of the form \lstinline[language=propositio]!I <A> <B>!, in which \lstinline[language=propositio]!<A>! denotes the sentence \(A\) and \lstinline[language=propositio]!<B>! the sentence \(B\). If for example \(A\) denotes \lstinline[language=propositio]!Alice! and \(B\) denotes \lstinline[language=propositio]!Bob!, \(A\rightarrow B\) denotes
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
I Alice Bob
\end{lstlisting}
. It reads ``\(A\) implies \(B\)'', which is clear from our construction. Similarly we write \(B=\neg A\) if \(B\) is of the form \lstinline[language=propositio]!N <A>!. It reads ``not \(A\).

We also write
\begin{eqna}
    \neg A\rightarrow B=A\vee B
\end{eqna}
which reads ``\(A\) or \(B\)'' and means \lstinline[language=propositio]!I N <A> <B>!, and
\begin{eqna}
    \neg(\neg A\vee\neg B)=A\wedge B,
\end{eqna}
which reads ``\(A\) and \(B\)'' and means \lstinline[language=propositio]!N I N <A> N <B>!, and
\begin{eqna}
    (A\rightarrow B)\wedge(B\rightarrow A)=A\leftrightarrow B,
\end{eqna}
which reads ``\(A\) is equivalent to \(B\)'' and means
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
N I N I <A> <B> I <B> <A>
\end{lstlisting}
. Interpretations as ``or'', ``and'' and ``is equivalent to'' will be justified later.

Now we can translate an English sentence into our propositional language.
\begin{quote}
    If Python is elegant or easy, people like it, and vice versa.
\end{quote}
Let's use \(A\)=\lstinline[language=propositio]!A! to mean the statement ``Python is elegant'', \(B\)=\lstinline[language=propositio]!B! to mean ``Python is easy'' and \(C\)=\lstinline[language=propositio]!C! to mean ``people like Python''. Then we have ``if \(A\) or \(B\), then \(C\), and vice versa``, or in informal symbols,
\begin{eqna}
    (A\vee B)\leftrightarrow C.
\end{eqna}
Writing \(D=A\vee B\), we have
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
N I N I <D> C I C <D>
\end{lstlisting}
, and since \(D\) means \lstinline[language=propositio]!I N A B!, the whole sentence becomes
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
N I N I I N A B C I C I N A B
\end{lstlisting}
.

Now that we can translate English into propositional logic sentences, we can tackle reasoning. When Jasmine presents her arguments, she first presents some asusmptions and then deduces lemmas out of them. She may provide more assumptions as the presentation goes on. Then she deduces more lemmas of assumptions and already proved lemmas finally arriving at her theorem. Therefore, a proof should be a sequence of sentences, each of them an assumption or a deduction based on earlier sentences in the proof.

The simplest deduction based on earlier results is that there's a sentence saying \(A\) holds, and another sentence saying that if \(A\), then \(B\). It is called Modus Ponens and it is the only deduction rule in proposition logic.

Our proof therefore stems from a set of assumptions \(A\) and is a sequence of sentences \(P_n\) such that each \(P_n\) is either an assumption or there's \(B\rightarrow P_k\) and \(B\) somewhere earlier in the proof.

\begin{maaritelma}
Let \(A\) be a set of sentences called assumptions. A proof from assumptions \(A\) is a finite string of symbols which consists of a concatention of sentences \(P_k\) separated with newline characters such that each \(P_k\in A\) or there is \(l,m<k\) such that \(P_l=\)\lstinline[language=propositio]!I <P_m> <P_k>!.
\end{maaritelma}
If a sentence \(X\) can be proven from assumptions \(A\), we write \(\vdash_AX\). For example, if we assume \propositio!I it_rains you_get_wet! and \propositio!it_rains!, we can form a simple proof
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
I it_rains you_get_wet
it_rains
you_get_wet
\end{lstlisting}
.

Some sentences seem to be universally valid, for example
\begin{eqna}
    \neg\neg A\rightarrow A
\end{eqna} for any sentence \(A\). It seems reasonable to expect that we can always assume any sentence of this form. We therefore put all such sentences in a special set of assumptions called axioms. For example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=propositio]
I N N pimpeli_pom pimpeli_pom
\end{lstlisting}
is an axiom.



Now, reasoning

\section{Set theory}

\section{Algebra}

\section{Topology}

Another elementary and important structure we can equip a set with is topology. It is a notion of nearness whitout distance which allows us to talk about convergence, which means approaching some point, and continuity of a function, which means that nearby points map to nearby points. Definition of topology is not very obvious, but the concept makes great intuitive sense. Topology captures that what is common with a torus and a coffee cup.

Given a set \(X\), set \(\mathcal{T}\subset2^X\) is called a topology on \(X\) if
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\emptyset\in\mathcal{T}\) and \(X\in\mathcal{T}\).
    \item Any finite union of elements of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\).
    \item Any intersection of elements of \(\mathcal{T}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\).
\end{itemize}
The pair \(\lbrace X,\mathcal{T}\rbrace\) is called a topological space and the elements of \(\mathcal{T}\) open sets of \(X\).

A set \(\mathcal{B}\) of sets of \(X\) is called a basis of topology \(\mathcal{T}\) if all unions of elements of \(\mathcal{B}\) is equal to \(\mathcal{T}\). For example open intervals \(]a,b[\), \(a,b\in\RR\), form a basis and generate the usual topology and concept of nearness in \(\RR\). More generally, open balls generate the usual topology of \(\RR^n\).

A sequence \(x_n\) of points in \(X\) is said to converge to point \(x\) if for any open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) there is \(n_U\) such that if \(n>n_U\), then \(x_n\in U\). For example \(1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\dotsc\) converges to \(0\) in \(\RR\)'s usual topology.

A function \(f:X\rightarrow Y\) from a topological space to another is continuos if the preimage of an open set is open, that is, the set of all the points in \(X\) of which image is in an open set of \(Y\) is always open. Continuity means the function's value does not change abruptly.

If a function is a bijection and continuous in both directions, it is a homeomorphism. Such a function preserves openness and topology. If there's a homeomorfism between two spaces, they're said to be homeomorphic, which means they are topologically similar. A cube and a ball are homeomorphic, a cube and a square aren't.

A group is said to be a topological group if the group operation is continuous in some topology.
